        simplify_tolerance: Largest deviation from the traced outline, in traced texels.
        edge_margin: Distance in traced texels the outline grows (positive) or shrinks (negative).
        min_island_area: Outline islands smaller than this many traced texels are dropped.
        minimal_outline: Connect the traced outline with the fewest vertices within ``simplify_tolerance``
            instead of the greedy Douglas-Peucker pass.
        disable_alpha_test: Author the opaque alpha state on the material so the runtime skips alpha testing.

        thickness: Extrusion distance in mesh units.
        thicken_back_face: Close the extrusion with a reversed copy of the front face.
        thicken_anti_stretch: Texture the extruded sides with a band inside the outline instead of smearing
            the edge.
